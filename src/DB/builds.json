And avoid being sapped and have enemy team collapsed on you (This you should only do when you are under 6 stacks).  \n",

            "Mastery for Resto Shamans is one of the strongest in the game and even more potent in random battlegrounds where focus fire rarely appears. Mastery boosts BoEs to BiS status for most slots, though some overstatted gear can match them. Stay away from proc stats i.e. crit and proc gear -- healers are more effective (and more fun) when consistent. One exception: Green Whelp Armor has no ICD, and is situationally a ton of fun when facing a bunch of melee classes.  \n  \n",

            "If you choose the engineering helm, don't use the Ghost Iron Dragonling trinket, and instead opt for either a straight stats trinket or the Ember (only drops for tanks, so you'll need a tank to trade it to you). The Talisman of the Breaker is really nice in a caster-heavy battleground to get you back into the action; the 5% healing throughput loss using it (due to missing stats compared to a BoE) is significant.  \n  \n",

            "Gem with int and whatever combination of vers and haste suit you. Use the Minor Speed boot enchant, the only speed enchant that stacks with Ghost Wolf. Caster proc enchants for weapons and necks aren't currently proc'ing for lower level characters in the 20-29 bracket, so go with static enchants.  \n  \n",
