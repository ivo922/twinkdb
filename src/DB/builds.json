To best be able to do that, it is highly recommended that you have 2 sets. 1 Set with the gear stated above with [](https://www.wowhead.com/item=32215/timeless-shadowsong-amethys) and another full set with [](https://www.wowhead.com/item=32200/solid-empyrean-sapphire). (Keep in mind, that for the most part, in random bgs, you want to run with +3 stamina gems at all times, but for wargaming, 2 sets is highly recommneded)  \n",
            "+2 stamina +2 int sems will help your team in MID, with casting out [](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=774/rejuvenation), and [](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8936/regrowth). And avoid being sapped and have enemy team collapsed on you (This you should only do when you are under 6 stacks).  \n",
            "+3 stamina gems is the most optimal route to take if you play in random bgs. Since random BGs aren't not like wargames. The composition can be different and the playstyle as well. So if you plan on wargaming having 2 sets is recommended.  \n",
            "+3 stamina gems gives you more survivability overall if you don't play wargames. Since you will have more HP. But again, it depends on what players you have on your team. If you have no healers, it is recommended that you play a mixture of +2 int +2 stamina gems alongside +3 stamina gems until you find your sweet spot.  \n  \n",

            "Talent: [](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260309/master-marksman ), I run this talent for the passive dot and damage. And in my opinion you're better off casting another [](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185358/arcane-shot) than using the other 2 choices. Targets generally don't last long enough to reap the full benifits of the others either.  \n  \n",

            "This build uses very little Versatility and no Insignia trinket. So be aware of your surroundings and kite like a pro. With this build I like to run around 20% Crit inside BG's, which isn't hard to do with all the blue socket gear you can get, nab it all up for the extra sockets as well for those agility gems. I prefer to add haste to this build as well for the GCD reduction, focus regen and faster [](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19434/aimed-shot) cast. Without it just feel like it takes forever to cast [](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19434/aimed-shot), and gives less time for your opponents to get out of range.  \n  \n",

            "I'm also not a huge fan of on use trinkets, I prefer sustained damage. With on use trinkets it always seems like they're on CD when you need them. And when they're not on CD you're waiting for the right time to use them. In the meantime you're loosing out on the extra damage you could've been doing from the straight stat trinkets."

            "For smoother gameplay I like to get the haste rating mentioned above (99 rating inside BGs), while you can go with less/more haste I feel like it's not hard to reach it while giving some nice benefits (1.2 sec casts and 1,25 GCD), both are important since in most situations you will try to have dots up on multiple players. Also no amount of haste is wasted on DoTs when the DoT is over any left over tick duration will be consumed for damage as well, so there is not real caps for DoTs anymore. 20% haste increases your DoT dmg by roughly 20%  \n \n",

            "Mastery for Resto Shamans is one of the strongest in the game and even more potent in random battlegrounds where focus fire rarely appears. Mastery boosts BoEs to BiS status for most slots, though some overstatted gear can match them. Stay away from proc stats i.e. crit and proc gear -- healers are more effective (and more fun) when consistent. One exception: Green Whelp Armor has no ICD, and is situationally a ton of fun when facing a bunch of melee classes.  \n  \n",

            "If you choose the engineering helm, don't use the Ghost Iron Dragonling trinket, and instead opt for either a straight stats trinket or the Ember (only drops for tanks, so you'll need a tank to trade it to you). The Talisman of the Breaker is really nice in a caster-heavy battleground to get you back into the action; the 5% healing throughput loss using it (due to missing stats compared to a BoE) is significant.  \n  \n",

            "Gem with int and whatever combination of vers and haste suit you. Use the Minor Speed boot enchant, the only speed enchant that stacks with Ghost Wolf. Caster proc enchants for weapons and necks aren't currently proc'ing for lower level characters in the 20-29 bracket, so go with static enchants.  \n  \n",
